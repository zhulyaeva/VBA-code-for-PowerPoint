# VBA-code-for-PowerPoint
In this repository you can find a code from a bunch of developers &amp; curious amateurs like me which can help you to convert graphs with the data behind them into images in PowerPoint. Could prove handy if anything has to be shared in PowerPoint format with an external party and the data is embedded within the deck itself.
Just copy and paste this code under a new macro in PowerPoint.
